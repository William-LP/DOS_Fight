# DOS Fight
## Trying to create a CLI game using GO

### Features list 
* Add a stuff list the player can buy from to enhance its stats 
* See how to implement an inventory system to contains the user consumables
* Add a skill list the user can pick abilities from (in addition of the class' skill)
* See how to allow players to play over the LAN 
* Ascii art to display the main menu (class selection etc) ?
* Adding a bet system to enrich wining player over time
* Save progression (VictoryCount, Gold ...) on disk using an encryption system to avoid player to cheat ?
* Give the player the oportunity to spend gold to interact with oponent's computer (displaying messages, taking screenshot, rebooting...)? Would be intrusive. But fun.
